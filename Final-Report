## Data Pipeline & Methodology Overview

### 1. **Simulated Healthcare Dataset Construction**
- **Domain-driven Simulation:** Generated synthetic data (n=5,000) with realistic patient demographics, clinical comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare utilization, using statistical distributions and interdependencies modeled after real-world patterns.
- **Readmission Risk Ground Truth:** Target variable (30-day readmission) calculated via a complex, non-linear risk score reflecting multifactorial healthcare realities, including interaction effects (e.g., diabetes+heart disease risk amplification).

### 2. **Advanced Data Preprocessing**
- **Missing Value Imputation:**  
  - Numeric features: KNNImputer for more accurate, context-aware completion of missing data.
  - Categorical features: Mode imputation.
- **Robust Encoding:** Label encoding for all categorical features, with logic to handle unseen categories for future inference/deployment.
- **Outlier Robust Scaling:** Used RobustScaler for normalization, reducing outlier impact typical in healthcare data.
- **Sophisticated Feature Engineering:**  
  - Created composite, interaction, and stratification features (e.g., comorbidity count, age and BMI bands, high-risk discharge, polypharmacy, complexity indicators).
  - Engineered risk indicators and patient complexity scores to enhance model discrimination.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**
- **Comprehensive Visual Suite:**  
  - Multi-faceted subplots (12-panel grid) covering age, comorbidities, LOS, admission/discharge, medication burden, prior ED visits, and BMI, enabling granular risk factor assessment.
  - Correlation heatmap for feature relationship diagnosis, supporting multicollinearity checks and model interpretability.
- **Statistical Profiling:**  
  - Key cohort statistics and risk factor readmission rates.
  - Drill-down: Elderly, high-comorbidity, long-stay, and polypharmacy populations identified as highest risk segments.

### 4. **Modeling and Clinical Decision Support (Code-ready)**
- **ML Algorithm Selection:**  
  - Built-in support for RandomForest, GradientBoosting, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and ensemble/meta-modeling.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation integrated for robust model selection.
  - Model calibration for probability accuracy—critical in clinical settings.
- **Risk Stratification & Explainability:**  
  - Engineered features and model outputs ready for SHAP, ROC, and precision-recall analysis (not shown in this EDA block, but supported in full code).
  - Feature importances preview panel built into EDA grid for transparency and operational trust.
