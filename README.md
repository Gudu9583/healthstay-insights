# 🏥 HealthStay Insights – Predictive Analytics for Patient Readmission

## 🚀 Project Overview

HealthStay Insights is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to predict hospital patient readmission risks using advanced machine learning and data-driven insights. By empowering healthcare providers with actionable intelligence, this project aims to optimize resource utilization, enhance patient care, and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Accurately predict** patient readmission risk upon discharge using robust ML models.
- **Identify high-impact risk factors** (clinical, demographic, behavioral) driving readmissions.
- **Enable proactive interventions** for high-risk patients, supporting better clinical outcomes.
- **Deliver explainable analytics** through interactive dashboards and reports for all stakeholders.

## 👩‍💻 My Role: Data Analyst (3+ years)

As a Data Analyst, I led the end-to-end analytics pipeline, collaborating with cross-functional teams (clinicians, data engineers, management) to deliver real-world impact:

- **Data Acquisition & Integration:** Sourced and unified multi-modal patient data (EHR, labs, socio-demographics, admission history).
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Devised pipelines for outlier detection, imputation, standardization, and anonymization to ensure data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered complex patterns and correlations using advanced statistics & visualization (seaborn, matplotlib, Power BI).
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafted domain-informed features (e.g., comorbidity scores, discharge timing, follow-up adherence).
- **Model Development & Evaluation:** Partnered with data scientists to build and fine-tune predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SHAP explainability).
- **Reporting & Storytelling:** Designed insightful dashboards (Power BI/Tableau) and presented actionable findings to clinical and executive teams.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Incorporated stakeholder feedback, tracked model drift, and iteratively enhanced solution performance.
